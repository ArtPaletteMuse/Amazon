    <h1>Unsupported Browser</h1>
    <h2>We regret to inform you that the browser you are using is not supported.</h2>

    <div class="callout warning">
      <p>
        Showoff uses many modern web technologies, such as CSS transforms and the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes">Flexbox layout mode</a>
        that's only been in use for about five years or so.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we'd dearly love to support your browser of choice, it's genuinely infeasible
        to do so. Instead, we suggest that you update to a more recent browser. Any major
        browser released in the last few years will work. Even Internet Explorer 11 or above
        will work reasonably well.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are on a corporate Windows machine with locked down installation privileges,
        we also suggest trying out <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable">Portable Chrome</a>,
        which will install into a self-contained bundle into your user profile only.
