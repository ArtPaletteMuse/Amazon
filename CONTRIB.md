Contributing
======================

To contribute to the Showoff project:

* Fork `puppetlabs/showoff`

* Use the presentations in the `example/` subdirectory to make sure you haven't broken
  existing functionality. These presentations are used as simple integration tests.

* Add an example presentation to validate any new features you add.

* Push your contribution to a branch named after your change:
    * Example: `git push origin master:fixed-static-links`

* Send me a pull request through GitHub with a description of what you are contributing.
