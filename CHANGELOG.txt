0.9.7.1
  Changed slave window popup behavior to work better with Chrome's popup
  handling.

0.9.7
  Merged in fixes and new features from upstream in preparation for taking
  over maintainership. I tried to keep attribution wherever I could, but
  I had to massage several commits, and had to re-implement a couple.

  New features:

  * Allows one to set a custom per slide background
  * Adds gherkin syntax highlighting
  * Adds support for the Kramdown markdown engine
  * Allows one to set markdown engine configuration options in showoff.json

  If you notice any regressions please file issues and we'll get them fixed.

0.9.6
  Ports client communication to websockets
  Adds audience interaction
    Pace feedback, slower/faster
    Ask a question
    Provide slide feedback
